# BSS-using-Shogun-Python-Package

- Its a package of some examples produced as instructions for shogun package Blind Source Separation tools
- Will be updated and new file will be posted eventually


# -------------------------------------------------------------------- #
SOBI_example.py: 

A simple example of Blind Source Separation (BSS) on mixes of four damped responses randomly superposed and noise added. 
For BSS purpose, Second Order Blind Identification technique is used. SOBI is included in shogun package for python. 
This example illustrated how the package can be used for this purpose. 
NOTE: damped responses usually cannot be simply separated by common separation techniques, such as PCA or ICA. However, SOBI 
is successful for this application.
